Ottoman is intended to be an easy to use CouchDB API for Mono/.NET applications.  Please 
excuse the mess, this is a new project and we are trying to get everything in order.  We 
will be setting up a project site, forum, and issue tracker.  This will be an active open 
source project and backed by a company.  We have big plans for this library.

== A little disclaimer

	Ottoman at it's current state is pre-alpha software and still under heavy development. 
	Please be aware that important areas such as the public API may see backwards 
	incompatible changes between versions.

== Repository Organization

	We recommend reading the great branching model that Vincent Driessen wrote up.  It 
	will help in understanding our development process when it comes to Git.
